## Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv4
## Limit network-transmitted configuration for IPv6
## Turn on execshield protection
## Prevent against the common 'syn flood attack'
## Turn on source IP address verification
## Prevents a cracker from using a spoofing attack against the IP address of the server.
